# Portfolio
I'm a Graphic Designer and I've decided to use this opportunity to show not only the projects carried out within Udacity but also some of my personal works. 
Even the graphics on the website (logo and background image) are my own creation.


### Documentation

I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create this project, in particular I select this [Theme](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-freelancer/) and I adapted it according to my needs.

Below I quickly illustrate the procedure I followed:

  - I designed a draft of the Portfolio
  - I selected a theme with a similar structure
  - I created the graphic elements for the site such as background image, logo and color study of the individual elements
  - I modified the structure of the code to insert the elements in the correct way and in general to change some settings that I wanted differently
